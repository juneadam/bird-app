# Bird-Dex

A web application for bird lovers to read about all the state birds in an 8-bit style, providing information about their whereabouts and characteristics. 

## Features

Use the dpad controller to peruse through the different state birds, with a few surpise bonue birds mixed in. 

Users can go to the next bird, as well as the previous bird.

Bird calls are also provided, to learn how each bird sounds. 

## Technical Details

This app is built using React, JavaScript, and Node.js. The focus of this app was to create a simple, one-page app that can cleanly parse through data in a user-friendly way, with efficient functionality. 

Using hooks, effects, and state, the backend functionality is re-usable and flexible. 

Styling was attached to each component separately to provide ultimate organization and easy styling manipulation.
